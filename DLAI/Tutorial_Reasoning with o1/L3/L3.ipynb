    "# Lesson 3: Planning with o1\n",
    "One of the great use cases where `o1` models shine is creating a plan to solve a task given a set of tools to carry out the plan, and constraints to set bounds around the task. This kind of use case would be very slow if we used `o1` for every step, so what we'll do is generate a plan with `o1-mini` and then execute each step with `gpt-4o-mini`."
